# Verchestra Specification State

## Decisions

### AD-001 — GitHub Pages website architecture

- **Status:** active
- **Decision:** Build the public website as the private `@verchestra/site` Astro workspace package and deploy static output through GitHub Actions to `https://accd.github.io/verchestra/`.
- **Rationale:** The website belongs with the product source, requires no runtime service, and must be reviewed and qualified with the same repository controls.

### AD-002 — Public website truth boundaries

- **Status:** active
- **Decision:** Repository Markdown remains canonical; website-only guides may live in the site package, and build-time adapters may project canonical documents without changing their source.
- **Rationale:** Public presentation must not create a second, drifting architecture or qualification record.

### AD-003 — Public status language

- **Status:** active
- **Decision:** The site describes `0.0.0-qualification`, T68 complete, and T69 next. It must not claim a public installer, production readiness, or a 1.0 release.
- **Rationale:** Evidence and release state take precedence over marketing language.

### AD-004 — Canonical agent instructions

- **Status:** active
- **Decision:** `AGENTS.md` is the only canonical agent instruction format; scoped files refine root rules and provider compatibility files are generated import-only pointers.
- **Rationale:** A provider-neutral hierarchy keeps a clean clone understandable without duplicated or drifting rules.

### AD-005 — Durable cross-agent memory

- **Status:** active
- **Decision:** Git, tracked specifications, decisions, tasks, validation evidence, and feature handoffs are the authoritative cross-agent memory.
- **Rationale:** Contribution and resumption must not depend on chat history, provider memory, an IDE, MCP, or an installed skill.

### AD-006 — LLM-readable content projection

- **Status:** active
- **Decision:** LLM-readable repository and website output is generated only from allowlisted canonical repository content and never becomes a second source of truth.
- **Rationale:** AI retrieval should preserve provenance, current qualification state, and the existing documentation authority boundary.

## Handoff

- **Feature:** `agent-ready-repository`
- **State:** T1 in progress; GitHub issue write blocked by integration permissions
- **Branch:** `agent/agent-ready-repository`
- **Completed:** The GitHub Pages feature is complete on protected `main`; its stale publication-pending handoff is retired. The agent-ready specification, design, tasks, and portable handoff are being established.
- **Verification:** T68 remains complete, T69 remains next, and this feature is independent of T69–T77.
- **Next:** Complete T1 status checks and proceed to root/scoped instructions.
